# Test Coverage Report

## Overall Coverage: 79%

The datacube implementation has good test coverage at 79% overall, but there are some specific areas that could benefit from additional tests:

## Coverage by Module

| Module | Statements | Missing | Coverage |
|--------|------------|---------|----------|
| scripts/cmip_processor.py | 189 | 77 | 59% |
| scripts/datacube_builder.py | 96 | 14 | 85% |
| scripts/test_cmip_processor.py | 98 | 7 | 93% |
| scripts/test_datacube_builder.py | 87 | 1 | 99% |

## Uncovered Areas

### cmip_processor.py (59% coverage)

The main areas missing coverage include:

1. Sections of the error handling in spatial bucketing (lines 110-118, 134, 137-144)
2. Parts of the temporal bucketing with different aggregation methods (lines 215-226, 237)
3. The combined spatial and temporal bucketing path (lines 272-303)
4. Error handling in the save_datacube method (lines 387-419)
5. Aspects of the temporal aggregation logic (lines 443-462)

### datacube_builder.py (85% coverage)

This module has better coverage, but still misses:

1. Some edge case handling in the create_unified_grid method (lines 153, 156, 159, 169, 199)
2. Error handling in the save_datacube method (lines 227-228)
3. Parts of the regridding functionality (lines 262, 274, 281-303)

## Recommended Test Additions

To improve test coverage, the following additions are recommended:

1. **Tests for combined spatial and temporal bucketing**: Add specific tests that exercise the path where both spatial and temporal bucketing are done simultaneously.

2. **Error handling tests**: Add tests that deliberately trigger error conditions, such as:
   - Invalid file paths
   - Non-existent dimensions
   - Empty datasets
   - Invalid aggregation methods

3. **Regridding tests**: Add more tests for the DatacubeBuilder's regridding functionality, specifically focusing on different interpolation methods and their effects.

4. **Edge case tests**: Add tests for edge cases like:
   - Single-point datasets
   - Datasets with different units
   - Datasets with missing values
   - Datasets with non-standard dimension names

## Priority Areas

The highest priority areas to address are:

1. The combined spatial and temporal bucketing path in CMIPProcessor (lines 272-303), as this is a key feature
2. Error handling in both modules' save_datacube methods
3. The regridding functionality in DatacubeBuilder

Adding tests for these areas will significantly improve the robustness and reliability of the datacube implementation.
