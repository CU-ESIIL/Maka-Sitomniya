This repository serves as the central hub for our working group, hosting our project description, proposals, member bios, codebase, and more. Our Project The world faces growing threats from multiple, interconnected environmental challenges, including chemical pollution, increasing freshwater demands amid diminishing supplies, biodiversity loss, and the climate crisis. Indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable due to a long history of injustice. However, a holistic worldview, long-standing relationship with the land and water, and time-tested stewardship practices provide essential knowledge for understanding and responding to these challenges. What remains lacking are the resources and technical expertise to integrate Indigenous Knowledges with the latest advancements in Earth Data Science. Our project aims to bridge this gap by developing a customizable DataCube and workflows tailored to the needs of Tribes. This framework will enable Indigenous communities to access and apply environmental data science (EDS) for vulnerability assessments, mitigation, and adaptation. It will aso serve as a training tool to build Tribal capacity in data analysis and decision-making. This work is critical because climate change and environmental degradation disproportionately impact Indigenous lands and livelihoods. Tribes would like to access the tools to analyze and interpret environmental data, and our project provides a framework to make informed decisions and strengthen inherent sovereignty. The expected impact of our project is threefold: Increased Tribal Access to Data Science \u2013 By making EDS more accessible, we support Indigenous-led environmental management and research. Capacity Building and Training \u2013 The DataCube will serve as an educational tool for Tribal Colleges, students, and community members, equipping them with technical skills. Stronger Environmental and Climate Resilience \u2013 With better data, Tribes can develop more effective policies and responses to environmental challenges, ensuring long-term sustainability. Advancing EDS is not just about pushing the boundaries of science\u2014it must also be about expanding accessibility, ensuring its benefits reach communities that would otherwise be excluded. Our project prioritizes soverignty, self-determination, and the integration of Indigenous Knowledges with cutting-edge environmental data tools to create lasting, meaningful change.

Fork &amp; Clone the Repository"},{"location":"what_is_a_datacube/","text":"What is a Data Cube in Earth Science? A data cube is a specific way to organize and store data. It's like a 3D table that helps scientists study and understand information faster and easier. In Earth Science, data cubes bring together different kinds of data, like where something is (location), when it happened (time), and what it is (type of data). This makes it easier to study how Earth systems, like weather or water, change over time. Think of a regular table in a spreadsheet. It has rows and columns, so it\u2019s two-dimensional. A data cube adds a third dimension (and sometimes more), making it perfect for studying things with more than two dimensions like temperatures, rainfall, and satellite images. Features of a Data Cube Dimensions A data cube has dimensions, or different ways to organize the data. In Earth Science, the most common dimensions are: Space: Where something is, like latitude and longitude or specific areas on a map. Time: When something happened, like daily, monthly, or yearly measurements. Variables: The type of information, like temperature, rainfall, or how green plants are. These dimensions are like the sides of a cube. Scientists can look at data from different angles, such as how much it rained in one place during one year or how the temperature changed over time. Cells (Data Points) Each tiny \"cell\" in the cube holds a specific piece of data based on the dimensions. For example: In a weather dataset, a cell might hold the average temperature for a certain place on a specific day. In a satellite data cube, a cell could hold the brightness of a pixel in a satellite image at a specific time. Goes Beyond Three Dimensions Even though it's called a \"cube,\" it doesn\u2019t stop at three dimensions. Scientists can add more dimensions, like the type of satellite or the kind of land (forest, grassland, etc.). These multi-dimensional cubes are sometimes called hypercubes. They help Earth scientists combine data from lots of sources. Analyze and Combine Data Data cubes let scientists analyze and summarize data in many ways. For example: Over Space: Find the average temperature for a whole country in one year. Over Time: Add up the total rainfall in a season for a watershed. Over Variables: See how forests changed alongside temperatures over the last decade. Example of a Data Cube Let\u2019s look at a simple example of a data cube used for studying land: Location (Cell) Month NDVI (Plant Greenness) Temperature (\u00b0C) 1, 1 Jan 0.72 23.5 1, 1 Feb 0.68 24.0 Dimensions in this Example: Space: The grid cell (a small square on a map). Time: The month of the year. Variables: NDVI (a number that shows how green plants are) and temperature. Each cell in the cube holds a specific value, like how green the plants were in January for one location or the temperature in February. How Do Scientists Use Data Cubes? Environmental Monitoring Tracking changes in forests, water quality, or land use over time. Watching how wildfires spread using satellite images. Climate Studies Storing and studying climate model data, like rainfall predictions or future temperature changes. Studying how droughts or floods might affect certain areas. Geospatial Analysis Bringing together data from satellites, maps, and field studies for detailed research. Finding answers to questions like: \"How much forest was lost in this region over 10 years?\" Helping with Decisions Helping governments and communities plan for things like droughts or floods. Supporting decisions about managing natural resources, like forests or water. Why is it Called a \"Cube\"? The term \"cube\" comes from its simplest form: a 3D shape like a box, with three sides (space, time, and data type). But in Earth Science, data cubes can have many more sides\u2014like a hypercube. This makes them useful for combining lots of information in one place. For example: A 3D cube could show temperature across space and time. A hypercube might add even more details, like the type of sensor used to collect data or the type of land. Why Are Data Cubes Important? Data cubes are powerful tools for organizing and analyzing information. They let scientists study Earth systems in detail, track changes over time, and make predictions for the future. Whether it\u2019s learning about climate change, protecting forests, or planning for floods, data cubes make it easier to understand the world and solve problems.","title":"What is a Data Cube in Earth Science?"},{"location":"what_is_a_datacube/#what-is-a-data-cube-in-earth-science","text":"A data cube is a specific way to organize and store data.

All ESIIL community members are responsible for creating this culture, embodying our values, welcoming diverse perspectives and ways of knowing, creating safe inclusive spaces, and conducting ethical science as guided by FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles for scientific and Indigenous data management, governance and stewardship. Our values ESIIL\u2019s vision is grounded in the conviction that innovation and breakthroughs in environmental data science will be precipitated by a diverse, collaborative, curious, and inclusive research community empowered by open data and infrastructure, cross-sector and community partnerships, team science, and engaged learning. As such, our core values center people through inclusion, kindness, respect, collaboration, and genuine relationships. They also center innovation, driven by collaborative, cross-sector science and synthesis, open, accessible data and tools, and fun, diverse teams. Finally, they center learning, propelled by curiosity and accessible, inclusive training, and education opportunities. When and how to use these guidelines These guidelines outline behavior expectations for ESIIL community members. Your participation in the ESIIL network is contingent upon following these guidelines in all ESIIL activities, including, but not limited to, participating in meetings, webinars, hackathons, working groups, hosted or funded by ESIIL, as well as email lists and online forums such as GutHub, Slack, and Twitter. These guidelines have been adapted from those of the International Arctic Research Policy Committee, the Geological Society of America, the American Geophysical Union, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, The Carpentries, and others. We encourage other organizations to adapt these guidelines for use in their own meetings. Note: Working groups and hackathon/codefest teams are encouraged to discuss these guidelines and what they mean to them, and will have the opportunity to add to them to specifically support and empower their team. Collaborative and behavior commitments complement data use, management, authorship, and access plans that commit to CARE and FAIR principles. Behavior Agreements ESIIL community members are expected to act professionally and respectfully in all activities, such that each person, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body size, race, religion, national origin, ethnicity, level of experience, language fluency, political affiliation, veteran status, pregnancy, country of origin, and any other characteristic protected under state or federal law, feels safe and welcome in our activities and community. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. In order to garner the benefits of a diverse community and to reach the full potential of our mission and charge, ESIIL participants must be allowed to develop a sense of belonging and trust within a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative culture. Guiding behaviors that contribute to this culture include, but are not limited to: Showing Respect Listen carefully \u2013 we each bring our own styles of communication, language, and ideas, and we must do our best to accept and accommodate differences. Do not interrupt when someone is speaking and maintain an open mind when others have different ideas than yours. Be present \u2013 when engaging with others, give them your full attention. If you need to respond to outside needs, please step away from the group quietly. Be kind \u2013 offer positive, supportive comments and constructive feedback. Critique ideas, not people. Harassment, discrimination, bullying, aggression, including offensive comments, jokes, and imagery, are unacceptable, regardless of intent, and will not be tolerated. Be punctual - adhere to the schedule provided by the organizers and avoid disruptive behavior during presentations, trainings, or working sessions. Respect privacy - be mindful of the confidentiality of others. Always obtain explicit consent before recording, sharing, or using someone else\u2019s personal information, photos, or recordings. Practice good digital etiquette (netiquette) when communicating online, whether in emails, messages, or social media - think before posting online and consider the potential impact on others. Do not share or distribute content generated by or involving others without their explicit consent. Being Inclusive Create space for everyone to participate \u2013 be thoughtful about who is at the table; openly address accessibility needs, and provide multiple ways to contribute. Be welcoming \u2013 ESIIL participants come from a wide range of skill levels and career stages, backgrounds, and cultures. Demonstrate that you value these different perspectives and identities through your words and actions, including through correct use of names, titles, and pronouns. Be self-aware \u2013 recognize that positionality, identity, unconscious biases, and upbringing can all affect how words and behaviors are perceived. Ensure that your words and behavior make others feel welcome. Commit to ongoing learning \u2013 the move toward inclusive, equitable, and just environmental data science is a collective journey. Continue to learn about and apply practices of inclusion, anti-racism, bystander intervention, and cultural sensitivity. None of us is perfect; all of us will, from time to time, fail to live up to our own high standards. Being perfect is not what matters; owning our mistakes and committing to clear and persistent efforts to grow and improve is. Being Curious Check your presumptions \u2013 we each bring our own ideas and assumptions about how the world should and does work \u2013 what are yours, and how do they affect how you interact with others? How do they shape your perception of new ideas? Ask questions \u2013 one of the strengths of interdisciplinary and diverse teams is that we all bring different knowledge and viewpoints; no one person is expected to know everything. So don\u2019t be afraid to ask, to learn, and to share. Be bold \u2013 significant innovations don\u2019t come from incremental efforts. Be brave in proposing and testing new ideas. When things don\u2019t work, learn from the experience. Invite feedback \u2013 new ideas and improvements can emerge from many places when we\u2019re open to hearing them. Check your defensiveness and listen; accept feedback as a gift toward improving our work and ourselves. Being Collaborative Recognize that everyone is bringing something different to the table \u2013 take the time to get to know each other. Keep an open mind, encourage ideas that are different from yours, and learn from each other\u2019s expertise and experience. Be accountable - great team science depends on trust, communication, respect, and delivering on your commitments. Be clear about your needs, as both a requester and a responder, realistic about your time and capacity commitments, and communicate timelines and standards in advance. Make assumptions explicit and provide context wherever possible - misunderstandings are common on transdisciplinary and cross-cultural teams and can best be managed with intentionality. Check in about assumptions, and be willing to share and correct misunderstandings or mistakes when they happen. Make use of collaboration agreements, communicate clearly and avoid jargon wherever possible. Respect intellectual property and Indigenous data sovereignty \u2013 ESIIL recognizes the extractive and abusive history of scientific engagement with Native peoples, and is committed to doing better. Indigenous knowledge holders are under no obligation to share their data, stories or knowledge. Their work should always be credited, and only shared with permission. Follow guidelines for authorship, Indigenous data sovereignty, and CARE principles. Acknowledge and credit the ideas and work of others. Use the resources that we provide - take advantage of the cyberinfrastructure and data cube at your disposal, but do not use them for unrelated tasks, as it could disrupt the event, introduce security risks, undermine the spirit of collaboration and fair play, and erode trust within the event community. Be safe - never share sensitive personal information; use strong passwords for your Cyverse and GitHub accounts and do not share them with other participants; be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or links; and verify online contacts. If you encounter any illegal or harmful activities online related to this event, report them to Tyler McIntosh or Susan Sullivan. Finally, speak up if you experience or notice a dangerous situation, or someone in distress! Code of Conduct: Unacceptable behaviors We adopt the full Code of Conduct of our home institution, the University of Colorado, details of which are found here . To summarize, examples of unacceptable and reportable behaviors include, but are not limited to: Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form Physical or verbal abuse by anyone to anyone, including but not limited to a participant, member of the public, guest, member of any institution or sponsor Unwelcome sexual attention or advances Personal attacks directed at other guests, members, participants, etc. Alarming, intimidating, threatening, or hostile comments or conduct Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations Threatening or stalking anyone Unauthorized use or sharing of personal or confidential information or private communication Continuing interactions, including but not limited to conversations, photographies, recordings, instant messages, and emails, after being asked to stop Ethical and scientific misconduct, including failing to credit contributions or respect intellectual property Engaging in any illegal activities, including hacking, cheating, or unauthorized access to systems or data Using the cyberinfrastructure provided by the organizers for activities unrelated to this event. Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting. The University of Colorado recognizes all Federal and State protected classes, which include the following: race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, marital status, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. Mistreatment or harassment not related to protected class also has a negative impact and will be addressed by the ESIIL team. Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If there is a clear violation of the code of conduct during an ESIIL event\u2014for example, a meeting is Zoom bombed or a team member is verbally abusing another participant during a workshop\u2014 ESIIL leaders, facilitators (or their designee) or campus/local police may take any action deemed necessary and appropriate, including expelling the violator, or immediate removal of the violator from any online or in-person event or platform without warning or refund. If such actions are necessary, there will be follow up with the ESIIL Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) team to determine what further action is needed (see Reporting Process and Consequences below). Addressing Behavior Directly For smaller incidents that might be settled with a brief conversation, you may choose to contact the person in question or set up a (video) conversation to discuss how the behavior affected you. Please use this approach only if you feel comfortable; you do not have to carry the weight of addressing these issues yourself. If you are interested in this option but unsure how to go about it, please contact the ESIIL DEI lead, Susan Sullivan, first\u2014she will have advice on how to make the conversation happen and is available to join you in a conversation as requested. Reporting Process and Consequences We take any reports of Code of Conduct violations seriously, and aim to support those who are impacted and ensure that problematic behavior doesn\u2019t happen again. Making a Report If you believe you\u2019re experiencing or have experienced unacceptable behavior that is counter to this code of conduct, or you are witness to this behavior happening to someone else, we encourage you to contact our DEI lead: Susan Sullivan, CIRES Email: susan.sullivan@colorado.edu You may also choose to anonymously report behavior to ESIIL using this form . The DEI team will keep reports as confidential as possible. However, as mandatory reporters, we have an obligation to report alleged protected class violations to our home institution or to law enforcement. Specifically: Cases of potential protected-class harassment will be reported to the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance. If the violation is made by a member of another institution, that information may also be shared with that member\u2019s home institution by the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance under Title IX. In some instances, harassment information may be shared with the National Science Foundation, who are the funding organization of ESIIL. When we discuss incidents with people who are accused of misconduct (the respondent), we will anonymize details as much as possible to protect the privacy of the reporter and the person who was impacted (the complainant). In some cases, even when the details are anonymized, the respondent may guess at the identities of the reporter and complainants. If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please let us know (or note that in your report). We encourage you to report in any case, so that we can support you while keeping ESIIL members safe. In some cases, we are able to compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action based on that pattern. If you prefer to speak with someone who is not on the ESIIL leadership team, or who can maintain confidentiality, you may contact: CU Ombuds Phone: 303-492-5077 (for guidance and support navigating difficult conversations) CU Office of Victim Assistance Phone: 303-492-8855 If you want more information about when to report, or how to help someone who needs to report, please review the resources at Don\u2019t Ignore It . Note: The reporting party does not need to be directly involved in a code of conduct violation incident. Please make a bystander report if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you. What Happens After a Report Is Filed After a member of the ESIIL DEI team takes your report, they will (if necessary) consult with the appropriate support people at CU. The ESIIL DEI team will respond with a status update within 5 business days. During this time, they, or members of the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance, will: Meet with you or review report documentation to determine what happened Consult documentation of past incidents for patterns of behavior Discuss appropriate response(s) to the incident Connect with the appropriate offices and/or make those response(s) Determine the follow-up actions for any impacted people and/or the reporter Follow up with the impacted people, including connecting them with support and resources. As a result of this process, in minor cases ESIIL DEI may communicate with the respondent to: Explain what happened and the impact of their behavior Offer concrete examples of how to improve their behavior Explain consequences of their behavior, or future consequences if the behavior is repeated. For significant infractions, follow up to the report may be turned over to the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance and/or campus police. Possible Consequences to Code of Conduct Violations What follows are examples of possible responses to an incident report. This list is not inclusive, and ESIIL reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary. Generally speaking, the strongest response ESIIL may take is to completely ban a user from further engagement with ESIIL activities and, as is required, report a person to the CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance and/or their home institution and NSF. If law enforcement should be involved, they will recommend that the complainant make that contact. Employees of CU Boulder may also be subject to consequences as determined by the institution. In addition to the responses above, ESIIL responses may include but are not limited to the following: A verbal discussion in person or via phone/Zoom followed by documentation of the conversation via email Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the code of conduct Not allowing a speaker who violated the code of conduct to give (further) talks Immediately ending any team leadership, membership, or other responsibilities and privileges that a person holds Temporarily banning a person from ESIIL activities Permanently banning a person from ESIIL activities Nothing, if the behavior is determined to not be a code of conduct violation Do you need more resources? Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact the ESIIL DEI lead, Susan Sullivan, if you have questions or concerns. The CU Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance is a resource for all of us in navigating this space. They also offer resource materials that can assist you in exploring various topics and skills here. If you have questions about what, when or how to report, or how to help someone else with concerns, Don\u2019t Ignore It. CU Ombud\u2019s Office: Confidential support to navigate university situations. (Most universities have these resources) The CU Office of Victims Assistance (counseling limited to CU students/staff/faculty, though advocacy is open to everyone engaged with a CU-sponsored activity. Please look for a similar resource on your campus if you are from another institution). National Crisis Hotlines How are we doing? Despite our best intentions, in some cases we may not be living up to our ideals of a positive, supportive, inclusive, respectful and collaborative community. If you feel we could do better, we welcome your feedback. Comments, suggestions and praise are also very welcome! Acknowledgment By participating in this event, you agree to abide by this code of conduct and understand the consequences of violating it. We believe that a respectful and inclusive environment benefits all participants and leads to more creative and successful outcomes. Thank you for your cooperation in making the this event a welcoming event for all.

If you have concerns about retaliation or your personal safety, please let us know (or note that in your report). We encourage you to report in any case, so that we can support you while keeping ESIIL members safe. In some cases, we are able to compile several anonymized reports into a pattern of behavior, and take action based on that pattern.

If law enforcement should be involved, they will recommend that the complainant make that contact. Employees of CU Boulder may also be subject to consequences as determined by the institution. In addition to the responses above, ESIIL responses may include but are not limited to the following: A verbal discussion in person or via phone/Zoom followed by documentation of the conversation via email Not publishing the video or slides of a talk that violated the code of conduct Not allowing a speaker who violated the code of conduct to give (further) talks Immediately ending any team leadership, membership, or other responsibilities and privileges that a person holds Temporarily banning a person from ESIIL activities Permanently banning a person from ESIIL activities Nothing, if the behavior is determined to not be a code of conduct violation Do you need more resources?

Docker is a containerization platform that enables you to package your applications along with their dependencies into self-contained units called containers. Containers provide a consistent and portable runtime environment, making it easy to develop, test, and deploy applications across different machines. Key Concepts Images A blueprint for a Docker container. Images are read-only and contain all the necessary code, libraries, and configurations for an application. Containers A running instance of a Docker image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system. Dockerfile A text file that defines the instructions needed to build a Docker image. Building a jupyterlab Docker Image using GitHub Actions Create a Dockerfile Create a new directory and Dockerfile within the project docker directory.

Most of the lines, however, are just Linux commands you would run from a terminal when provisioning a new VM. Each block of code is commented with what it accomplishes. Add any necessary files The Dockerfile above uses a file called environment.yml to provision the its conda environment and a jupyter_config_notebook.json file to configure the jupyterlab server. Both of these files will need to be added to the docker/jupyterlab directory at the same level as the Dockerfile. You can view the content of these files in this repository. Create the GitHub actions workflow file Workflow files specify when and how code is executed in a GitHub Actions workflow. Actions can be triggered automatically, such as when a commit is pushed to a repo or a specific file, or they can be triggered manually. The following workflow is defined so that the Action is triggered manually. Actions can also be run on different VM types. The following Action will be run on the latest Ubuntu image. name: build-and-push-jupyterlab-image on: workflow_dispatch: # This allows you to manually trigger the action from GitHub UI. jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v3.5.0 - name: Set up Docker Buildx id: buildx uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2.5.0 - name: Login to dockerhub uses: docker/login-action@v2.1.0 with: username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }} password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }} - name: Get lowercase repo name (for dynamic tags) id: repo_name run: | lowercase_name=$(echo ${{ github.event.repository.name }} | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') echo \"::set-output name=repo_name::${lowercase_name}\" - name: Build and push latest id: docker_build_jupyterlab uses: docker/build-push-action@v4.0.0 with: context: docker/jupyterlab file: docker/jupyterlab/Dockerfile builder: ${{ steps.buildx.outputs.name }} push: true tags: | esiil/${{ steps.repo_name.outputs.repo_name }}_jupyterlab:latest - name: Image digest run: echo ${{ steps.docker_build.outputs.digest }} The steps section of the file defines what will be run by the Action. An overview of the steps of this file is as follows: Checkout the repository code, setup Docker buildx, login to DockerHub, resolve the name of the current GitHub reposiroy, build and push the Docker Image to DockerHub. Running the Action From your repositories GitHub page, click on the Actions tab Find the workflow in the Workflow navigation menu and click on it Click on the run workflow dropdown and click Run Workflow Deploying the Image on CyVerse First go to de.cyverse.org and login. From there go to the Apps dashboard and click on Manage Tools. Adding the Image as a Tool Then click Add Tool. Give the Tool a descriptive name and set the initial version. The version can be whatever you like but 1.0 makes the most sense. Set the Image Name to esiil/name_of_your_image and the tag to whichever tag you would like the Tool to use. Most Tools will use the latest tag. You can see all of this information on the ESIIL dockerhub page. Leave the Entrypoint, Working Directory, and UID blank. Add port 8888 as a container port. Leave all of the restrictions blank and then save the Tool Associating the Tool with an App Go back to the Apps dashboard and click create Just like for the Tool, give a descriptive name and description For \"Tool used\" click select and then search for the name of the tool that was just added and then click on its row and then select at the bottom. From the app creation screen click Next, and then click next through the next steps until you get to completion. From there click Save and Launch From there you can go through the deployment of your app like you would deploy any other app on CyVerse and test it out.","title":"Docker"},{"location":"resources/docker_basics/#docker-basics","text":"","title":"Docker Basics"},{"location":"resources/docker_basics/#what-is-docker","text":"Docker is a containerization platform that enables you to package your applications along with their dependencies into self-contained units called containers.

Math Notation Markdown can be combined with LaTeX for mathematical notation, useful in environmental data science for expressing statistical distributions, coordinate systems, and more. This requires a Markdown renderer with LaTeX support (like MathJax or KaTeX). Inline Math : Use single dollar signs for inline math expressions. Representing the normal distribution. Example: The probability density function of the normal distribution is given by $f(x|\\mu,\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}$.` Display Math : Use double dollar signs for standalone equations. Example: $$ f(x|\\mu,\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2} $$ Common LaTeX Elements for Environmental Data Science : Statistical Distributions : Normal Distribution: \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2} for $\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2}$ Poisson Distribution: P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!} for $P(k; \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}$ Coordinate Systems : Spherical Coordinates: (r, \\theta, \\phi) for $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$ Cartesian Coordinates: (x, y, z) for $(x, y, z)$ Geospatial Equations : Haversine Formula for Distance: a = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1)\\cos(\\phi_2)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{2}\\right) for $a = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1)\\cos(\\phi_2)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{2}\\right)$ Note: The rendering of these equations as formatted math will depend on your Markdown viewer's LaTeX capabilities. 7.
