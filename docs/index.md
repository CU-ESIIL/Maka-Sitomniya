# Maka-Sitomniya

Welcome to the Maka-Sitomniya repository, part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository serves as the central hub for our working group, hosting our project description, proposals, member bios, codebase, and more.

## Our Project

The world faces growing threats from multiple, interconnected environmental challenges, including chemical pollution, increasing freshwater demands amid diminishing supplies, biodiversity loss, and the climate crisis. Indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable due to a long history of injustice. However, a holistic worldview, long-standing relationship with the land and water, and time-tested stewardship practices provide essential knowledge for understanding and responding to these challenges. What remains lacking are the resources and technical expertise to integrate Indigenous Knowledges with the latest advancements in Earth Data Science.

Our project aims to bridge this gap by developing a customizable DataCube and workflows tailored to the needs of Tribes. This framework will enable Indigenous communities to access and apply environmental data science (EDS) for vulnerability assessments, mitigation, and adaptation. It will aso serve as a training tool to build Tribal capacity in data analysis and decision-making. This work is critical because climate change and environmental degradation disproportionately impact Indigenous lands and livelihoods. Tribes would like to access the tools to analyze and interpret environmental data, and our project provides a framework to make informed decisions and strengthen inherent sovereignty.

The expected impact of our project is threefold:

- Increased Tribal Access to Data Science – By making EDS more accessible, we support Indigenous-led environmental management and research.
- Capacity Building and Training – The DataCube will serve as an educational tool for Tribal Colleges, students, and community members, equipping them with technical skills.
- Stronger Environmental and Climate Resilience – With better data, Tribes can develop more effective policies and responses to environmental challenges, ensuring long-term sustainability.

Advancing EDS is not just about pushing the boundaries of science—it must also be about expanding accessibility, ensuring its benefits reach communities that would otherwise be excluded. Our project prioritizes soverignty, self-determination, and the integration of Indigenous Knowledges with cutting-edge environmental data tools to create lasting, meaningful change.

## Customize Your Repository

As a new working group, you'll want to make this repository your own. Here's how to get started:

1. **Edit This Readme**: Replace the placeholder content with information about your specific project. Ensure that the introduction, project overview, and objectives clearly reflect your group's research focus.

2. **Update Group Member Bios**: Add details about each group member's expertise, role in the project, and professional background. Include links to personal or professional web pages to foster community engagement and collaboration.

3. **Organize Your Code**: Structure your codebase in a way that is logical and accessible. Use directories and clear naming conventions to make it easy for all members to find and contribute to different parts of the project.

4. **Document Your Data**: Include a data directory with README files explaining the datasets, sources, and any preprocessing steps. This will help new members understand and work with the project's data effectively.

5. **Outline Your Methods**: Create a detailed METHODS.md file where you describe the methodologies, software, and tools you will be using in your research. This transparency will support reproducibility and collaborative development.

6. **Set Up Project Management**: Utilize the 'Issues' and 'Projects' features on GitHub to track tasks, discuss ideas, and manage your workflow. This can help in maintaining a clear view of progress and priorities.

9. **Review and Merge Workflow**: Decide on a workflow for reviewing and merging changes. Will you use branch protection? Who will have merge privileges? Document this process to avoid confusion.

10. **Establish Communication Channels**: Beyond GitHub, set up additional communication channels like Slack, Discord, or email lists for quick and informal discussions.

Remember, the goal is to make your repository clear, accessible, and useful for all current and future members of your working group. Happy researching!
