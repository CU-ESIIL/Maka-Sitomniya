# Maka-Sitomniya

Welcome to the Maka-Sitomniya repository, part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository serves as the central hub for our working group, hosting our project description, proposals, member bios, codebase, and more.

## Our Project

The world faces growing threats from multiple, interconnected environmental challenges, including chemical pollution, increasing freshwater demands amid diminishing supplies, biodiversity loss, and the climate crisis. Indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable due to a long history of injustice. However, a holistic worldview, long-standing relationship with the land and water, and time-tested stewardship practices provide essential knowledge for understanding and responding to these challenges. What remains lacking are the resources and technical expertise to integrate Indigenous Knowledges with the latest advancements in Earth Data Science.

Our project aims to bridge this gap by developing a customizable DataCube and workflows tailored to the needs of Tribes. This framework will enable Indigenous communities to access and apply environmental data science (EDS) for vulnerability assessments, mitigation, and adaptation. It will aso serve as a training tool to build Tribal capacity in data analysis and decision-making. This work is critical because climate change and environmental degradation disproportionately impact Indigenous lands and livelihoods. Tribes would like to access the tools to analyze and interpret environmental data, and our project provides a framework to make informed decisions and strengthen inherent sovereignty.

The expected impact of our project is threefold:

- Increased Tribal Access to Data Science – By making EDS more accessible, we support Indigenous-led environmental management and research.
- Capacity Building and Training – The DataCube will serve as an educational tool for Tribal Colleges, students, and community members, equipping them with technical skills.
- Stronger Environmental and Climate Resilience – With better data, Tribes can develop more effective policies and responses to environmental challenges, ensuring long-term sustainability.

Advancing EDS is not just about pushing the boundaries of science—it must also be about expanding accessibility, ensuring its benefits reach communities that would otherwise be excluded. Our project prioritizes soverignty, self-determination, and the integration of Indigenous Knowledges with cutting-edge environmental data tools to create lasting, meaningful change.
