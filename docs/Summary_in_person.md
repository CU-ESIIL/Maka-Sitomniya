**Summary – Data Cube Planning Meeting (Tuesday)**

1\. **Group Structure Proposal**:

- Break into smaller groups:
  - Tech Team: Focus on building the data cube, defining use cases, and creating analytic workflows.
  - Education/Outreach Team: Promote ethical research processes and support Native master’s and PhD students.
  - Decision-Maker/Management Team: Address intellectual property (IP) agreements and policy development.

2\. Tech Team Key Points:

- Data Organization:
  - Structure data from a watershed perspective, starting with watersheds in treaty territories.
  - Incorporate Lakota terms (e.g., mni, inyan, maka).
  - Reference the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe map for place names.
- Data Categories:
  - Core categories: Water, earth, air, wildlife, imagery, climate, cultural/sacred sites.
  - Include data for legal and environmental frameworks (e.g., treaty rights, climate justice, fire management).
- Metadata Requirements:
  - Provide workflows for users (e.g., how to analyze bison habitat or hydrologic budgets).

3\. Education/Outreach Team Key Points:

- Support Native graduate research and ethical data use.
- Identify funding for tribal member science scholarships.
- Develop an Environmental Data Science (EDS) workforce certificate at Tribal colleges (OLC, SBC, SGU).
- Create a code of ethics for external researchers.

4\. Decision-Maker/Management Team Key Points:

- Draft intellectual property agreements affirming inherent Tribal ownership.
- Establish guidelines for defining and protecting special Tribal data (e.g., sacred sites, land data, winter counts).
- Design a Tribal-approved Data Management Plan aligned with NSF guidelines.

5\. Policy and Cultural Framework:

- Statement of Inherent Ownership:
  - Assert sovereignty over data related to Tribal identity, land, and cultural knowledge.
  - Define sovereign Tribal data (sacred sites, mineral resources, biological data).
- Rights Declaration:
  - Control data collection, storage, and dissemination.
  - Demand redaction or removal of sensitive data from public records.
  - Ensure equitable benefit sharing and enforce data attribution.
  - Establish Tribal oversight for data use and access.

6\. Governance and Decision-Making:

- Disputes and questions on data sovereignty must be resolved by the Oceti Sakowin Treaty Council.

7\. **Open Questions**:

- Who determines data access rights and defines data guardrails?
- How to circumvent Western accreditation models while ensuring data integrity?
- How to manage non-public data and implement appropriate metadata?
- How to enforce data discretion for existing government-held Tribal data?
- What does a unified stance for Oceti Sakowin and other Tribes look like for the Supreme Court?

**Summary of Key Points:**

Cyverse and Data Management

- Data Transfer and Security: Discussed methods to transfer data from Cyverse to secure locations, including the use of Spatiotemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC) for spatial data filtering.
- Access and Sharing: Cyverse allows controlled data sharing (read-only or full access) with specific users or the public, including DOI creation for published data.
- Tools and Integration: Demonstrated workflows for integrating Cyverse with QGIS and ArcGIS, including WebDAV access and writing code for dynamic data retrieval.
- Long-term data curation: Plans to support evolving datasets through automation, while considering multi-modal datasets and machine-readability.
- Collaborations: Exploring how ESIIL interacts with Cyverse and the potential to establish local servers (e.g., physical servers on Rosebud) connected to Cyverse through federated systems.

**ESIIL and Earth Lab Collaboration**

- User Experience: Emphasis on understanding how different users might access the Data Cube, use information, and engage with workflows. A powerpoint is available to guide this process.
- Capacity Building: Focus on building internal expertise, equiping users to create solutions, and demonstrating value through tangible products.
- Hardware and Sensors: Upcoming demo of data cube use by ESIIL scientists, with ongoing work on workflow documentation.

**Policy and Legal Considerations**

- Tribal Data Sovereignty: Emphasis on developing clear guidelines for researchers who encounter sensitive Tribal data. Legal input is sought to shape a data sovereignty statement centered on Indigenous governance and the CARE principles.
- Intellectual Property: Clarified that CU owns IP created by CU employees, NSF owns outputs funded by NSF, but Tribal data remains within Tribal rights.

**Community and Next Steps**

- **Collaboration and Engagement**: Need for stronger collaboration with local Tribal IT staff, outreach to high school students, and maintaining focus on data sovereignty and cultural values.
- **Workflows and Documentation**: Prioritizing clear documentation, user-centered workflows, and assigning responsibilities for ongoing work. There is an emphasis on supporting qualitative local data and expanding to other Tribes.
- **Funding and Grants**: Identified funding opportunities (e.g., EPA Climate Resilience Support) and the need to align efforts for upcoming grant proposals.
- **Vision and Philosophy**: Rooted in Lakota cultural frameworks (Wolakota values) and focused on equiping Tribes to make informed decisions while protecting sensitive data.

**Action Items**

1. **Workflow Development**: Finalize and document workflows specific to Tribal data and user needs.
2. **Data Sovereignty Statement**: Work with legal advisors to refine a statement focused on Indigenous Knowledge governance.
3. **Community Building**: Foster stronger relationships with Tribal institutions (e.g., Rosebud IT staff) and promote local capacity development.
4. **Regular Check-Ins**: Establish ongoing meetings to maintain momentum and cohesion across teams.
5. **Grant Preparation**: Collaborate on upcoming funding proposals (e.g., OLC’s June deadline) and identify broader grant opportunities.
