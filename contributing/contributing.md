Using GitHub Desktop (For Non-Technical Users)
>GitHub Desktop makes it easier to contribute without using the command line.
1. Install GitHub Desktop
   - Download it from GitHub Desktop.
   - Install and log in with your GitHub account.
2. Clone the Repository
   - Open GitHub Desktop.
   - Click "File" → "Clone Repository."
   - Select "GitHub.com" and choose the repository Maka Sitomniya.
   - Click "Clone."
3. Make Changes
   - Open the repository folder on your computer.
   - Edit files as needed (e.g., in Notepad or VS Code or your preferred editor).
   - Return to GitHub Desktop, where changes will be listed.
   - Write a summary of your changes and click "Commit to main/branch."
4. Push Changes
   - Click "Push origin" to upload your changes.
   - On GitHub, open a Pull Request to submit your changes.

Handling Merge Conflicts
>Merge conflicts happen when two people edit the same part of a file.
>Here’s how to fix them:

1. Identify the Conflict
   - If you see an error like this when pulling changes:
   - CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
   - It means Git doesn’t know which version to keep.
2. Open the Conflicted File
The file will contain markers like this:
   - <<<<<<< HEAD
   - Your changes here
   - =======
   - Someone else's changes
   - >>>>>>> feature-branch
3. Manually Resolve the Conflict:
   - Decide which version to keep, or merge them manually.
   - Then remove the conflict markers (<<<<, ====, >>>>).
4. Mark as resolved:
   - git add filename.txt
   - git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in filename.txt"
5. Then push your changes again:
   - git push origin your-branch
